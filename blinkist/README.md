Intendedly use for educational purpose only.

This script is initially made for The Skimmers from Vietnam, so as to get easier access to long and short skimming paragraphs.

Since there are over 3,000 books at the time I wrote this script, mid of 2020, and there are 40 new titles per month, it's so convenient to have a decent repository for long run of our team too.

There are many books appeared in the multiple categories, some are uncategorized, so I kept two scripts for the tasks:

- Updating the most recent books: ./skimmers.py
- Get books by categories: ./categorize.py
- Packing md and docx files from local folder: ./packing.py

All the result I got is at first run, so need to maintain code furthur for better updating later. How to better maintain folders structure that easier later for uploading to Google Drive.
