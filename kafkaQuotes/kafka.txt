So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to.

“One of the first signs of the beginning of understanding is the wish to die. This life appears unbearable, another unattainable. One is no longer ashamed of wanting to die; one asks to be moved from the old cell, which one hates, to a new one, which one willl only in time come to hate. In this there is also a residue of belief that during the move the master will chance to come along the corridor, look at the prisoner and say: "This man is not to be locked up again, He is to come with me.”

“Alas," said the mouse, "the whole world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap that I must run into."

“When one is alone, imperfection must be endured every minute of the day; a couple, however, does not have to put up with it. Aren’t our eyes made to be torn out, and our hearts for the same purpose? At the same time it’s really not that bad; that’s an exaggeration and a lie, everything is exaggeration, the only truth is longing. But even the truth of longing is not so much its own truth; it’s really an expression for everything else, which is a lie. This sounds crazy and distorted, but it’s true. Moreover, perhaps it isn’t love when I say you are what I love the most - you are the knife I turn inside myself, this is love. This, my dear, is love.”

Then, without his consent, his head sank down to the floor, and from his nostrils streamed his last weak breath.”

He's sure to open the door again for it's a room which perhaps one cannot leave. If only the first one were not precisely like the second, if he were calm, if he would only pretend not to look at the other, if he slowly set the room in order as though it were a room like any other; but instead he does exactly the same as the other at his door, sometimes even both are behind the doors and the the beautiful room is empty.”

“What's happened to me,' he thought. It was no dream.”
%
“Everyone carries a room about inside him. This fact can even be proved by means of the sense of hearing. If someone walks fast and one pricks up one’s ears and listens, say in the night, when everything round about is quiet, one hears, for instance, the rattling of a mirror not quite firmly fastened to the wall.”
%
“But sleep? On a night like this? What an idea! Just think of how many thoughts a blanket smothers while one lies alone in bed, and how many unhappy dreams it keeps warm.”

“I want in fact more of you. In my mind I am dressing you with light; I am wrapping you up in blankets of complete acceptance and then I give myself to you. I long for you; I who usually long without longing, as though I am unconscious and absorbed in neutrality and apathy, really, utterly long for every bit of you.”
%
“Writing is a deeper sleep than death. Just as one wouldn't pull a corpse from its grave, I can't be dragged from my desk at night.”

“If I could drown in sleep as I drown in fear I would be no longer alive.”

“Pienso que sólo debemos leer libros de los que muerden y pinchan. Si el libro que estamos leyendo no nos obliga a despertarnos como un puñetazo en la cara, ¿para qué molestarnos en leerlo? ¿Para que nos haga felices, como dice tu carta? Cielo santo, ¡seríamos igualmente felices si no tuviéramos ningún libro! Los libros que nos hagan felices podríamos escribirlos nosotros mismos, si no nos quedara otro remedio. Lo que necesitamos son libros que nos golpeen como una desgracia dolorosa, como la muerte de alguien a quien queríamos más que a nosotros mismos, libros que nos hagan sentirnos desterrados a los bosques más remotos, lejos de toda presencia humana, algo semejante al suicidio. Un libro debe ser el hacha que rompa el mar helado dentro de nosotros. Eso es lo que creo”.”

“So then you’re free?’ ‘Yes, I’m free,’ said Karl, and nothing seemed more worthless than his freedom.”
%
“You once said that you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; that utmost of self-revelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind-- for everyone wants to live as long as he is alive-- even the degree of self-revelation and surrender is not enough for writing.Writing that springs from the surface of existence-- when there is no other way and deeper wells have dried up-- is nothing, and collapses the moment a truer emotion makes the surface shake. That is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough.”

“There has never been a time in which I have been convinced from within myself that I am alive. You see, I have only such a fugitive awareness of things around me that I always feel they were once real and are now fleeting away. I have a constant longing, my dear sir, to catch a glimpse of things as they may have been before they show themselves to me. I feel that they were calm and beautiful.

“What a fate: to be condemned to work for a firm where the slightest negligence at once gave rise to the gravest suspicion! Were all the employees nothing but a bunch of scoundrels, was there not among them one single loyal devoted man who, had he wasted only an hour or so of the firm's time in the morning, was so tormented by conscience as to be driven out of his mind and actually incapable of leaving his bed?”

“There they lay, but not in the forgetfulness of the previous night.

“Each of us has his own way of emerging from the underworld, mine is by writing. That's why the only way I can keep going, if at all, is by writing, not through rest and sleep. I am far more likely to achieve peace of mind through writing than the capacity to write through peace.”

“If the book we are reading does not wake us, as with a fist hammering on our skulls, then why do we read it? Good God, we also would be happy if we had no books and such books that make us happy we could, if need be, write ourselves. What we must have are those books that come on us like ill fortune, like the death of one we love better than ourselves, like suicide. A book must be an ice axe to break the sea frozen inside us.What we need are books that hit us like a most painful misfortune, like the death of someone we loved more than we love ourselves, that make us feel as though we had been banished to the woods, far from any human presence, like a suicide. A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us.”

When the sage says: "Go over," he does not mean that we should cross over to some actual place, which we could do anyhow if the labor were worth it; he means some fabulous yonder, something unknown to us, something too that he cannot designate more precisely, and therefore cannot help us here in the very least. All these parables really set out to say merely that the incomprehensible is incomprehensible, and we know that already. But the cares we have to struggle with every day: that is a different matter.Concerning this a man once said: Why such reluctance? If you only followed the parables you yourselves would become parables and with that rid yourself of all your daily cares.Another said: I bet that is also a parable.The first said: You have won.The second said: But unfortunately only in parable.The first said: No, in reality: in parable you have lost.”

“Before the Law stands a doorkeeper on guard. To this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper says that he cannot admit the man at the moment. The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later. 'It is possible,' answers the doorkeeper, 'but not at this moment.' Since the door leading into the Law stands open as usual and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man bends down to peer through the entrance. When the doorkeeper sees that, he laughs and says: 'If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my permission. But note that I am powerful. And I am only the lowest doorkeeper. From hall to hall keepers stand at every door, one more powerful than the other. Even the third of these has an aspect that even I cannot bear to look at.' These are difficulties which the man from the country has not expected to meet, the Law, he thinks, should be accessible to every man and at all times, but when he looks more closely at the doorkeeper in his furred robe, with his huge pointed nose and long, thin, Tartar beard, he decides that he had better wait until he gets permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at the side of the door. There he sits waiting for days and years. He makes many attempts to be allowed in and wearies the doorkeeper with his importunity. The doorkeeper often engages him in brief conversation, asking him about his home and about other matters, but the questions are put quite impersonally, as great men put questions, and always conclude with the statement that the man cannot be allowed to enter yet. The man, who has equipped himself with many things for his journey, parts with all he has, however valuable, in the hope of bribing the doorkeeper. The doorkeeper accepts it all, saying, however, as he takes each gift: 'I take this only to keep you from feeling that you have left something undone.' During all these long years the man watches the doorkeeper almost incessantly. He forgets about the other doorkeepers, and this one seems to him the only barrier between himself and the Law. In the first years he curses his evil fate aloud; later, as he grows old, he only mutters to himself. He grows childish, and since in his prolonged watch he has learned to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar, he begs the very fleas to help him and to persuade the doorkeeper to change his mind. Finally his eyes grow dim and he does not know whether the world is really darkening around him or whether his eyes are only deceiving him. But in the darkness he can now perceive a radiance that streams immortally from the door of the Law. Now his life is drawing to a close. Before he dies, all that he has experienced during the whole time of his sojourn condenses in his mind into one question, which he has never yet put to the doorkeeper. He beckons the doorkeeper, since he can no longer raise his stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend far down to hear him, for the difference in size between them has increased very much to the man's disadvantage. 'What do you want to know now?' asks the doorkeeper, 'you are insatiable.' 'Everyone strives to attain the Law,' answers the man, 'how does it come about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?' The doorkeeper perceives that the man is at the end of his strength and that his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: 'No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended only for you. I am now going to shut it.”

A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us. That is what I believe.”

“Surveyor, in your thoughts you may be reproaching Sordini for not having been prompted by my claim to make inquiries about the matter in other departments. But that would have been wrong, and I want this man cleared of all blame in your thoughts. One of the operating principles of authorities is that the possibility of error is simply not taken into account. This principle is justified by the excellence of the entire organization and is also necessary if matters are to be discharged with the utmost rapidity. So Sordini couldn’t inquire in other departments, besides those departments wouldn’t have answered, since they would have noticed right away that he was investigating the possibility of an error.” “Chairman, allow me to interrupt you with a question,” said K., “didn’t you mention a control agency? As you describe it, the organization is such that the very thought that the control agency might fail to materialize is enough to make one ill.” “You’re very severe,” said the chairman, “but multiply your severity by a thousand and it will still be as nothing compared with the severity that the authorities show toward themselves. Only a total stranger could ask such a question. Are there control agencies? There are only control agencies. Of course they aren’t meant to find errors, in the vulgar sense of that term, since no errors occur, and even if an error does occur, as in your case, who can finally say that it is an error.”

If I remain faithful to this metaphor, then the goal of my aims, my questions, my inquiries, appears monstrous, it is true. For I want to compel all dogs thus to assemble together, I want the bones to crack open under the pressure of their collective preparedness, and then I want to dismiss them to the ordinary life they love, while all by myself, quite alone, I lap up the marrow. That sounds monstrous, almost as if I wanted to feed on the marrow, not merely of bone, but of the whole canine race itself. But it is only a metaphor.

“He had always believed that his father had not been able to save a penny from the business, at least his father had never told him anything to the contrary, and Gregor, for his part, had never asked him any questions. In those days Gregor's sole concern had been to do everything in his power to make the family forget as quickly as possible the business disaster which had plunged everyone into a state of total despair. And so he had begun to work with special ardor and had risen almost overnight from stock clerk to traveling salesman, which of course had opened up very different money-making possibilities, and in no time his successes on the job were transformed, by means of commissions, into hard cash that could be plunked down on the table at home in front of his astonished and delighted family. Those had been the wonderful times, and they had never returned, at least not with the same glory, although later on Gregor earned enough money to meet the expenses of the entire family and actually did so. They had just gotten used to it, the family as well as Gregor, the money was received with thanks and given with pleasure, but no special feeling of warmth went with it any more. ”

For instance, when I come back to the inn during the course of the morning to write up the necessary orders, these gentlemen are just sitting down to breakfast. If I were to try that with my boss, I'd be thrown out on the spot. Still, who knows whether that mightn't be really good for me? If I didn't hold back for my parents' sake, I'd have quit ages ago. I would've gone to the boss and told him just what I think from the bottom of my heart. He would've fallen right off his desk! How weird it is to sit up at that desk and talk down to the employee from way up there. The boss has trouble hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close to him. Anyway, I haven't completely given up that hope yet. Once I've got together the money to pay off my parents' debt to him—that should take another five or six years—I'll do it for sure. Then I'll make the big break. In any case, right now I have to get up. My train leaves at five o'clock”

“أمام القانون- فرانز كافكايجلس بوابٌ أمام القانون حارساً. يأتي إليه رجل من الريف طالباً السماح له بالدخول إليه. لكن البواب يقول بأن ليس بمستطاعه السماح له بالدخول في الحال. فكر الرجل ملياً بالأمر ومن ثم سأل فيما إذا كان سيسمح له بذلك لاحقاً. " هذا ممكن،" يقول البواب،" لكن ليس الآن." ولما كانت البوابة المفضية إلى القانون مفتوحة حالياً، كما دائماً، وقد تنحى البواب جانباً، انحنى الرجل رغبة في اختلاس النظر عبر البوابة إلى الداخل. ضحك البواب عندما لاحظ ذلك، وقال: " إذا كان هذا يغريك كثيراً، حاول أن تتخطاني . لكن ليكن في علمك: أني قوي. وأنا لست سوى البواب الأكثر تواضعاً. لكن من غرفة إلى أخرى يقف البوابون، وكل واحد أكثر قوة من الآخر. حتى أنه لا يمكنني الصمود أمام طرفة عين من الثالث." لم يكن الرجل القادم من الريف يتوقع كل هذه الصعوبات: وفكر بأن القانون لا بد أن يكون متاحاً للجميع دائماً، لكن وهو ينظر الآن عن كثب إلى البواب الذي يرتدي معطفاً من الفراء، إلى أنفه المدبب الكبير و لحيته، التترية السوداء، المهلهلة، الطويلة، قرر بأنه سيكون من الأفضل انتظار الحصول على تصريح بالدخول. أعطاه البواب مقعداً وسمح له بالجلوس جانباً أمام البوابة. جلس هناك لأيام وسنين. قام بالعديد من المحاولات ليدعه يدخل، وقد أضجر البواب بإلحاحه. كثيراً ما كان البواب يحدثه باختصار، سائلاً إياه عن موطنه و أشياء عديدة أخرى، لكنها أسئلة لا مبالية، مثل الأسئلة التي يطرحها العظماء، وينتهي دائما بتصريح مفاده أنه لا يمكنه السماح له بعد بالدخول. الرجل، الذي جهز نفسه بأشياء كثيرة لرحلته، ضحى بها جميعا، مهما بلغت قيمتها، لاستمالة البواب. الذي قبل بها كلها، لكن دائما مع ملاحظة: " أنا آخذ هذا فقط كي لا تعتقد بأنك لم تفعل ما بوسعك." ركز الرجل اهتمامه على البواب خلال السنوات الطويلة على نحو يكاد يكون مستمراً. و نسي أمر البوابين الآخرين، وبدا له أن هذا الأول هو العائق الوحيد أمام دخوله إلى القانون. لعن حظه السيء في السنوات الأولى بجرأة و بأعلى صوته ، فيما بعد وهو يتقدم في السن، اكتفى بأن تمتم لنفسه. صار خرفاً، وبما أنه أمضى السنوات الطوال في تأمل البواب بات يعرف حتى البراغيث في ياقته المصنوعة من الفرو، و طلب منها أيضاً أن تساعده على إقناع البواب. أخيرا وقد ضعف بصره، لم يعرف فيما إذا كانت الأشياء المظلمة من حوله حقيقة أو أن عيناه كانتا تخدعانه. لكنه يتبين الآن في الظلمة شعاع لا يخبو يتدفق من البوابة المفضية إلى القانون. الآن ولم يعد لديه بقية من حياة. تلخصت قبل موته في ذهنه خبراته كلها في سؤال وحيد لم يطرحه على البواب بعد. لوح له كي يقترب، ذلك أنه لم يعد يقوى على النهوض بجسده المتيبس. كان على البواب أن ينحني عليه، لأن الفارق الكبير بالطول بينهما تبدل لغير صالح الرجل." ما الذي لا زلت ترغب في معرفته، إذن؟" سأل البواب." أنت نهم."" الجميع يسعى وراء القانون،" قال الرجل، " فكيف حدث خلال هذه السنين الطوال أن ما من أحد سواي توسل الدخول؟" رأى البواب بأن الرجل شارف على الموت وحتى يتمكن من سماعه، صاح في أذنه: " ما من أحد آخر يسمح له بالدخول إلى هنا أبداً، لأن هذه البوابة قد خصصت فقط من أجلك. وأنا الآن سأقوم بإغلاقها.”

“In front of the law there is a doorkeeper. A man from the countryside comes up to the door and asks for entry. But the doorkeeper says he can't let him in to the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if he'll be able to go in later on. "That's possible," says the doorkeeper, "but not now". The gateway to the law is open as it always is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over to try and see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says, "If you're tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I say you can't. Careful though: I'm powerful. And I'm only the lowliest of all the doormen. But there’s a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of them is more powerful than the last. It's more than I can stand just to look at the third one.”

“É bom quando nossa consciência sofre grandes ferimentos, pois isso a torna mais sensível a cada estímulo. Penso que devemos ler apenas livros que nos ferem, que nos afligem. Se o livro que estamos lendo não nos desperta como um soco no crânio, por que perder tempo lendo-o? Para que ele nos torne felizes, como você diz? Oh Deus, nós seríamos felizes do mesmo modo se esses livros não existissem. Livros que nos fazem felizes poderíamos escrever nós mesmos num piscar de olhos. Precisamos de livros que nos atinjam como a mais dolorosa desventura, que nos assolem profundamente – como a morte de alguém que amávamos mais do que a nós mesmos –, que nos façam sentir que fomos banidos para o ermo, para longe de qualquer presença humana – como um suicídio. Um livro deve ser um machado para o mar congelado que há dentro de nós”

“There is a story, for instance, that has very much the ring of truth about it. It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a night without a break — as these officials are indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps. The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the official and, as I've already mentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials against them. On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside. In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out. One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps. That went on for about an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very tired and went back to his office.”

“He speaks to Klamm, but is it Klamm? Isn’t it rather someone who merely resembles Klamm? Perhaps at the very most a secretary who is a little like Klamm and goes to great lengths to be even more like him and tries to seem important by affecting Klamm’s drowsy, dreamlike manner. That part of his being is easiest to imitate, many try to do so; as for the rest of his being, though, they wisely steer clear of it. And a man such as Klamm, who is so often the object of yearning and yet so rarely attained, easily takes on a variety of shapes in the imagination of people. For instance, Klamm has a village secretary here called Momus. Really? You know him? He too keeps to himself but I have seen him a couple of times. A powerful young gentleman, isn’t he? And so he probably doesn’t look at all like Klamm? And yet you can find people in the village who would swear that Momus is Klamm and none other than he. That’s how people create confusion for themselves. And why should it be any different at the Castle?”

That was why, he said, the moment of waking up was the riskiest moment of the day.

“It is entirely conceivable that life's splendour forever lies in wait about each one of us in all its fullness, but veiled from our view, deep down, invisible, far off. It is there, though, not hostile, not reluctant, not deaf. If you summon it by the right word, by its right name, it will come. This is the essence of magic, which does not create but summonsFranz Kafka, 18 October 1921Es ist sehr gut denkbar, dass die Herrlichkeit des Lebes um jeden und immer in ihrer ganzen Fülle bereitliegt, aber verhängt, in der Tiefe, unsichtbar, sehr weit. Aber sie liegt dort, nicht feindselig, nicht widerwillig, nicht taub. Ruft man sie mit dem richtigen Wort, beim richtigen Namen, dann kommt sie. Das ist das Wesen der Zauberei, die nicht schafft, sondern ruft.Kafkas Tagebücher,18 Oktober 1921”

“Seen with the terrestrially sullied eye, we are in a situation of travelers in a train that has met with an accident in a tunnel, and this at a place where the light of the beginning can no longer be seen, and the light of the end is so very small a glimmer that the gaze must continually search for it and is always losing it again, and, furthermore, both the beginning and the end are not even certainties. Round about us, however, in the confusion of our senses, or in the supersensitiveness of our senses, we have nothing but monstrosities and a kaleidoscopic play of things that is either delightful or exhausting according to the mood and injury of each individual. What shall I do? or: Why should I do it? are not questions to be asked in such places.”

“I had to arrange things as well as I could. That's obviously a very bad place for the bed, in front of the door. For instance when the judge I'm painting at present comes he always comes through the door by the bed, and I've even given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the studio when I'm not home. Although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when I'm still asleep. And of course, it always wakes me up when I hear the door opened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am. If you could hear the way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you'd lose all respect for judges. I suppose I could take the key away from him but that'd only make things worse. It only takes a tiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges.”

“When the little mouse, which was loved as none other was in the mouse-world, got into a trap one night and with a shrill scream forfeited its life for the sight of the bacon, all the mice in the district, in their holes were overcome by trembling and shaking; with eyes blinking uncontrollably they gazed at each other one by one, while their tails scraped the ground busily and senselessly. Then they came out, hesitantly, pushing one another, all drawn towards the scene of death. There it lay, the dear little mouse, its neck caught in the deadly iron, the little pink legs drawn up, and now stiff the feeble body that would so well have deserved a scrap of bacon.The parents stood beside it and eyed their child's remains.”

“Mientras estaba tendido allí, a un paso de mí yacía un escarabajo, patas arriba, desesperado. No podía enderezarse, me habría gustado ayudarlo, era tan fácil hacerlo, bastaba un paso y un empujoncito para brindarle una ayuda efectiva. Pero lo olvidé a causa de la carta. Además no podía ponerme de pie. Por fin, una lagartija logró que volviera a tomar conciencia de la vida que me rodeaba. Su camino la llevó hasta el escarabajo, que ya estaba totalmente inmóvil. De modo que no fue un accidente, me dije, sino una lucha mortal, el raro espectáculo de la muerte natural de un animal. Pero la lagartija al deslizarse por encima del escarabajo, lo enderezó. Por uno instantes continuó inmóvil, como muerto, pero luego trepó la pared como la cosa más natural. Es probable que eso me haya brindado, de alguna manera, un poco de coraje. Lo cierto es que me puse de pie, bebí leche y le escribí a usted.”

“In our folk nobody has any experience of youth, there’s barely even any time for being a toddler. The children simply don’t have any time in which they might be children........Indeed... there’s simply no way that we would be able to provide our children with a viable childhood, one that is real. Naturally, there are consequences. There’s a certain ever present, not to be liquidated childishness that permeates our folk; We often act in ways that are totally and utterly ridiculous and, indeed, precisely like children we do things that are crazy, letting loose with our assets in a manner that is bereft of all rationality, prodigious in our celebrations, partaking in a light-headed frivolousness that is divorced from all sensibility, and often enough all simply for the sake of some small token of fun, so much do we love having our small amusements. But our folk isn’t only childish, to a certain extent we also age prematurely, childhood and old age mix themselves differently with us than by others. We don’t have any youth, we jump right away into maturity and, then, we remain grown-ups for too long and as a consequence to this there’s a broad shadow of a certain tiredness and a sort of hopelessness that colours our essential nature, a nature that as a whole is otherwise so tenacious and permeated by hope, strong hope. This, no doubt, this is related to why we’re so disinclined toward music—we’re too old for music, so much excitement, so much passion doesn’t sit well with our heaviness;”

The roof of this wretched life, of which you say so many hard things, will burst open, and all of us, shoulder to shoulder, will ascend into the lofty realm of freedom. And if we should not achieve the final consummation, if things should become worse than before, if the whole truth should be more insupportable than the half-truth, if it should be proved that the silent are the guardians of existence, if the faint hope that we still possess should give way to complete hopelessness, the attempt is still worth the trial, since you do not desire to live as you are compelled to live.”

Nó phải đem lại sự thỏa mãn lớn hơn tình dục bởi nó tách bạch khỏi lạc thú và những lúc người ngứa ngáy vì thèm...Đàn ông và đàn bà sẽ không bao giờ yêu nhau chân thành bằng hai người bạn vì quan hệ nam nữ bị sự quyến rũ làm cho thối nát. Họ diễn kịch. Tệ hơn, mỗi người trong số họ đều tìm những vai đẹp. Sân khấu. Hài kịch. Dối trá.

Observations on the weakness of language, and comparisons between the limitations of words and the infinity of feelings, are quite fallacious. The infinite feeling continues to be as infinite in words as it was in the heart. What is clear within is bound to become so in words as well. This is why one need never worry about language, but at sight of words may often worry about oneself. After all, who knows within himself how things really are with him? This tempestuous or floundering or morasslike inner self is what we really are, but by the secret process by which words are forced out of us, our self-knowledge is brought to light, and though it may still be veiled, yet it is there before us, wonderful or terrible to behold.”

“For example, my choice of career. You generously and patiently gave me complete freedom.  Though this followed the habits, or at least the values, of the Jewish middle class concerning their sons.  And here your misunder-standing of my character worked its effect, which – together with your father’s pride – blinded you to my real nature: to my weakness.  In your opinion, I was always studying as a child, and  later I was always writing.  Looking back that      is certainly not true.  I can say with very little exaggeration, I barely studied and I learnt nothing; to have retained something after so many years of education wasn’t remarkable for a man with a memory and some intelligence;  but given the vast expenditure of time and money, and my outwardly easy, unburdened life, what I achieved with regard to knowledge, especially sound knowledge, was nothing – certainly when compared to what others managed.  It is lamentable, but for me understandable.  I always had such a deep concern about the continued existence of my mind and spirit, that I was indifferent to everything else.  Jewish schoolboys have a reputation, for amongst them one finds the most improbable things; but my cold, barely disguised, permanent, childish, ridiculous, animal, self-satisfied indifference, and my cold and fantastical mind, are not things that I have ever met again – though admittedly they were just a defence against nervous destruction through fear and guilt.  And I was worried about myself in all manner of ways.  For example, I was worried about my health: I was worried about my hair falling out, my digestion, and my back – for it was stooped.  And my worries turned to fear and it all ended in true sickness.  But what was all that?  Not actual bodily sickness.  I was sick because I was a disinherited son, who needed constant reassurance about his own peculiar existence, who in the most profound sense never owned anything, and who was even insecure about the thing which was next to him: his own body. ”

Thus their conversations consist only of a coming-together of their imaginations, outpourings of wishes from one upon the other...

And, what is more, you charge me with it in such a way as to make it seem my fault, as though I might have been able, with something like a touch on the steering wheel, to make everything quite different, while you aren't in the slightest to blame, unless it be for having been too good to me.This, your usual way of representing it, I regard as accurate only in so far as I too believe you are entirely blameless in the matter of our estrangement. But I am equally entirely blameless. If I could get you to acknowledge this, then what would be possible is—not, I think, a new life, we are both much too old for that—but still, a kind of peace . . .”

“Sometimes he mulled over the idea that the next time the door opened he would take control of the family affairs as he had done in the past; these musings led him once more after such a long interval to conjure up the figures of the boss, the head clerk, the salesmen, the apprentices, the dullard of an office manager, two or three friends from other firms, a sweet and fleeting memory of a chambermaid in one of the rural hotels, a cashier in a milliner's shop whom he had wooed earnestly but too slowly- they all appeared mixed up with strangers or nearly forgotten people, but instead of helping him and his family they were each and every one unapproachable, and he was relieved when they evaporated.”

“I was a timid child. For all that, I am sure I was also obstinate, as children are. I am sure that Mother spoiled me too, but I cannot believe I was particularly difficult to manage; I cannot believe that a kindly word, a quiet taking by the hand, a friendly look, could not have got me to do anything that was wanted of me. Now you are, after all, basically a charitable and kindhearted person (what follows will not be in contradiction to this, I am speaking only of the impression you made on the child), but not every child has the endurance and fearlessness to go on searching until it comes to the kindliness that lies beneath the surface. You can treat a child only in the way you yourself are constituted, with vigor, noise, and hot temper, and in this case such behavior seemed to you to be also most appropriate because you wanted to bring me up to be a strong, brave boy.”

“I’ve never seen Klamm, Frieda doesn’t like me very much, as you know, and she would never have let me have a look at him; but of course they know very well what he looks like in the village, some people have seen him, they’ve all heard of him, and from these glimpses and rumours, as well as some deliberately misleading reports, a picture of Klamm has emerged that is probably generally accurate. But only generally; otherwise it varies, and perhaps it doesn’t even vary as much as Klamm’s actual appearance. He is supposed to look quite different when he arrives in the village and when he leaves, different before and after he’s been drinking beer, different when he’s awake and when he’s asleep, different when he’s alone and when he’s talking to someone – and then, as you can imagine, almost completely different up at the Castle. And even when he’s in the village there are reports of quite substantial differences, differences in his height, his shape, his weight, his beard. Fortunately, there’s one thing the descriptions agree about, his clothes – he’s always dressed the same: in a black frock coat with long tails. Of course, all these differences are due to magic, they are quite understandable because they depend on the present mood, the level of excitement, the countless degrees of hope or despair on the part of the observer, who is in any case only able to catch a momentary glimpse of Klamm. I’m telling you all this just as Barnabas has often explained it to me, and on the whole it’s reassuring as long as one’s not directly or personally involved. It doesn’t affect me, but for Barnabas it’s a matter of vital importance whether it’s really Klamm he is talking to or not.’ ‘It’s”

Acolo petrecură ore întregi, ore de răsuflare în comun, de bătăi de inimă comune, ore în care K. avea mereu senzaţia că se rătăceşte pe meleaguri străine sau că a ajuns atât de departe ca nimeni înaintea lui, într-o străinătate unde nici măcar aerul nu avea vreun comportament din atmosfera de acasă, unde trebuie să te sufoci de înstrăinare şi unde, împresurat de tentaţiile ei absurde, nu poţi face totuşi altceva decât să mergi înainte, să rătăceşti mai departe. Aşa că nu simţi spaimă în primul moment, ci mai degrabă o revenire consolatoare din obnubilaţie, când auzi că o voce profundă, poruncitor-calmă, o strigă pe Frieda din camera lui Klamm. "Frieda !" îi zice K. la ureche, transmiţându-i astfel chemarea. Mânată de o supunere de-a dreptul înnăscută, Frieda voia să sară în picioare, dar apoi îşi aminti unde se află, îşi întinse braţele, râse încetişor şi zise :- Cum îţi închipui că o să mă duc. Nu mai mă duc niciodată la el. K. voia să o contrazică, s-o convingă să se ducă la Klamm, începu să strângă de pe jos ce mai rămăsese din bluza ei, dar nu era în stare să spună nimic, era prea fericit s-o ţină pe Frieda între mâinile lui, prea fericit şi temător în acelaşi timp, căci i se păre că dacă Frieda îl părăseşte, îl părăseşte tot ce-i al lui.”

“But I must remind you, it was before you that I lost my self-respect, and gained a boundless sense of guilt. (Recollecting this boundlessness I once wrote of someone, ‘He feared the shame that would outlive him.’)  I couldn’t suddenly change when I was with other people; indeed with other people I felt even more guilty because of your attitude towards them – I felt implicated in this and I had to atone for your words.  And you always spoke badly of people that I had dealings with – sometimes openly, sometimes secretly – and I had to atone for that as well.  In business and in the family you tried to instil a mistrust of people in my mind (when I admired someone, you buried him with criticism).  And you could do this without it weighing you down (you were strong enough for that) though your attitude might just have been a lordly affectation.  But your mistrust was misplaced, with my childish eyes I couldn’t see what you  saw: for everywhere there were extraordinary, unmatchable people – so instead I gained a mistrust of myself, and an abiding fear of everyone.  So in this respect your influence on me was absolute.  And you didn’t see that; possibly because you had not experienced my sort of dealings with people, and so you were doubtful and jealous (but do I deny that you loved me?) and you thought that I had found some sort of compensation elsewhere, for you couldn’t imagine that I lived in the outside world as I did in your presence. Yet as child I found some comfort in my mistrust of my judgement: I doubted my insight, I said to myself, ‘Like all children you exaggerate, you feel little things too much and believe they have great weight.’  But this comfort dwindled as I grew up and has almost vanished.

“Sợ hãi là đối thủ thực sự duy nhất của cuộc sống. Chỉ có sợ hãi mới đánh bại được cuộc sống. Nó là một đối thủ khôn ngoan và xảo quyệt, tôi biết điều này quá rõ. Nó không có liêm sỉ, không tuân thủ bất cứ một luật lệ gì, không biết thương xót. Nó tấn công chỗ yếu nhất của ta, và bao giờ cũng tìm thấy chỗ đó một cách dễ dàng. Nó luôn luôn tấn công trước hết vào tinh thần của ta. Ta đang bình tĩnh, chủ động, hạnh phúc. Đùng một cái, sợ hãi, ngụy trang dưới dạng một nghi ngờ, nhẹ nhàng, lẻn vào tinh thần ta như một tên gián điệp. Nghi ngờ gặp phải Không tin và Không tin cố đánh bật nó ra. Nhưng không tin là một anh lính quèn kém võ trang. Nghi ngờ loại anh này ra khỏi vòng chiến một cách dễ dàng. Ta bắt đầu lo lắng, bồn chồn. Lý lẽ liền xung trận bảo vệ ta. Ta thấy yên lòng lại. Lý lẽ được trang bị bằng mọi thứ vũ khí và công nghệ hiện đại nhất. Nhưng, trước sự kinh ngạc của ta, mặc dù đã có những chiến thuật siêu đẳng và một số chiến thắng không thể phủ nhận, Lý lẽ vẫn bị yếu thế. Ta lại thấy yếu lòng, hoang manh. Nỗi lo lắng và bồn chồn của ta trở thành kinh hoàng. Lúc ấy, Sợ hãi dồn toàn lực sang cơ thể ta, vốn đã lờ mờ cảm thấy có chuyện chẳng lành đang xảy ra. Lập tức, hai lá phổi ta vỗ cánh bay mất như một con chim, và ruột gan ta thì như bầy rắn hốt hoảng trườn đi. Rồi đến lưỡi ta cứng đơ lại, còn hàm thì bắt đầu phi nước kiệu tại chỗ. Tai ta điếc đặc. Cơ bắp bắt đầu run rẩy như sốt rét và hai đầu gối thì lắc như múa. Tim ta thắt lại quá nhỏ và các cơ vòng thì lỏng ra quá nhiều. Và tất cả các bộ phận khác cũng vậy. Bộ phận nào cũng hỏng, theo kiểu riêng của chúng. Chỉ có hai con mắt là vẫn chạy tốt. Chúng luôn chú ý đến Sợ hãi.Và thế là ta nhanh chóng có những quyết định rất tai hại. Ta bỏ rơi những đồng minh cuối cùng của mình là Hy vọng và Tin tưởng. Đó là lúc ta đã tự đánh bại chính mình. Và Sợ hãi, thực chất chỉ là một ấn tượng, đã đánh bại ta.Chuyện đó rất khó nói ra bằng lời. Bởi vì Sợ hãi, nỗi Sợ hãi thực sự, hằn sâu vào tận cốt tủy như khi ta phải đối mặt với cái chết, sẽ làm tổ trong kí ức ta như một ổ thịt thối: nó tìm cách làm thối mọi thứ, kể cả những lời sẽ phải dùng để nói về chính nó. Cho nên ta phải tranh đấu kịch liệt để diễn đạt nó ra. Ta phải chiến đấu đến cùng để làm rõ ràng ánh sáng của những lời dùng để nói về nó. Bởi lẽ nếu không thế, nếu nỗi Sợ hãi của ta trở thành một cõi đen tối không lời mà ta lẩn tránh, thậm chí còn có thể lãng quên, ta sẽ bỏ ngỏ chính ta cho những cuộc tấn công khác nữa của Sợ hãi, vì ta đã chưa bao giờ thực sự kháng cự kẻ đã từng đánh bại ta.”

“Oto masz, drogi Maksie, dwie książki i kamyk. Zawsze starałem się znaleźć na Twoje urodziny coś, co wskutek swej obojętności nie zmieniałoby się, nie gubiło, nie psuło i nie mogło być zapomniane. A dumając potem miesiącami, znów nie widziałem innego ratunku, niż wysłać Ci książkę. Z książkami jest jednak utrapienie, z jednej strony są obojętne, a potem znów z drugiej o tyle bardziej interesujące, potem zaś pociągnęło mnie do tych obojętnych tylko przekonanie, które bynajmniej nic we mnie nie rozstrzygnęło, w końcu zaś, ciągle jeszcze z odmiennym przekonaniem, trzymałem w ręku książkę, która paliła tak tylko z ciekawości. Kiedyś nawet z rozmysłem zapomniałem o Twoich urodzinach, co było wszak lepsze niż posłanie książki, ale dobre nie było. Dlatego wysyłam Ci teraz ten kamyczek i będę Ci go wysyłał póki naszego życia. Będziesz go trzymać w kieszeni, ochroni Cię, wsadzisz do szuflady, również nie będzie bezczynny, ale jeśli go wyrzucisz, będzie najlepiej. Bo wiesz, Maksie, moja miłość do Ciebie jest większa niż ja sam i bardziej ja w niej mieszkam niż ona we mnie, i ma też kiepską podporę w mojej niepewnej istocie, tym sposobem jednak dostanie w kamyczku skalne mieszkanie i niechby to było tylko w szczelinie bruku na Schalengasse. Od dawna już ratowała mnie ona częściej niż sądzisz, a właśnie teraz, gdy wiem o sobie mniej niż kiedykolwiek i odczuwam siebie z pełną świadomością jedynie w półśnie, tylko tak nadzwyczaj lekko, tylko teraz jeszcze - krążę tak niczym z czarnymi wnętrznościami - dobrze zatem zrobi ciśnięcie w świat takiego kamyka i oddzielenie w ten sposób pewnego od niepewnego. Czym są wobec tego książki! Książka zaczyna Cię nudzić i już nie przestanie albo porwie ją twoje dziecko, albo, jak ta książka Walsera, rozlatuje się już, kiedy ją dostajesz. Przy kamyku przeciwnie, nic nie może Cię znudzić, taki kamyk nie może też ulec zniszczeniu, a jeśli już, to dopiero po długim czasie, także zapomnieć go nie można, ponieważ nie masz obowiązku o nim pamiętać, w końcu nie możesz go też nigdy ostatecznie zgubić, gdyż na pierwszej lepszej żwirowej drodze znajdziesz go z powrotem, bo jest to właśnie pierwszy lepszy kamyk. A jeszcze nie mógłbym mu zaszkodzić większą pochwałą, szkody z pochwał powstają bowiem tylko wtedy, gdy pochwała chwaloną rzecz rozgniata, niszczy lub zapodziewa. Ale kamyczek? Krótko mówiąc, wyszukałem Ci najpiękniejszy prezent urodzinowy i przekazuję Ci go z pocałunkiem, który ma wyrażać niezdarne podziękowanie za to, ze jesteś.”

If K. had not dismissed him already, this performance would have made him do so; it almost degraded the onlooker. So this was the effect of the advocate's method, to which K. had fortunately not been exposed for too long: the client finally forgot the whole world and could only drag himself along this illusory path to the end of his trial.

“Ante la Ley hay un guardián. Hasta ese guardián llega un campesino y le ruega que le permita entrar a la Ley. Pero el guardián responde que en ese momento no le puede franquear el acceso. El hombre reflexiona y luego pregunta si es que podrá entrar más tarde. —Es posible —dice el guardián—, pero ahora, no. Las puertas de la Ley están abiertas, como siempre, y el guardián se ha hecho a un lado, de modo que el hombre se inclina para atisbar el interior. Cuando el guardián lo advierte, ríe y dice: —Si tanto te atrae, intenta entrar a pesar de mi prohibición. Pero recuerda esto: yo soy poderoso. Y yo soy sólo el último de los guardianes. De sala en sala irás encontrando guardianes cada vez más poderosos. Ni siquiera yo puedo soportar la sola vista del tercero. El campesino no había previsto semejantes dificultades. Después de todo, la Ley debería ser accesible a todos y en todo momento, piensa. Pero cuando mira con más detenimiento al guardián, con su largo abrigo de pieles, su gran nariz puntiaguda, la larga y negra barba de tártaro, se decide a esperar hasta que él le conceda el permiso para entrar. El guardián le da un banquillo y le permite sentarse al lado de la puerta. Allí permanece el hombre días y años. Muchas veces intenta entrar e importuna al guardián con sus ruegos. El guardián le formula, con frecuencia, pequeños interrogatorios. Le pregunta acerca de su terruño y de muchas otras cosas; pero son preguntas indiferentes, como las de los grandes señores, y al final le repite siempre que aún no lo puede dejar entrar. El hombre, que estaba bien provisto para el viaje, invierte todo —hasta lo más valioso— en sobornar al guardián. Este acepta todo, pero siempre repite lo mismo: —Lo acepto para que no creas que has omitido algún esfuerzo. Durante todos esos años, el hombre observa ininterrumpidamente al guardián. Olvida a todos los demás guardianes y aquél le parece ser el único obstáculo que se opone a su acceso a la Ley. Durante los primeros años maldice su suerte en voz alta, sin reparar en nada; cuando envejece, ya sólo murmura como para sí. Se vuelve pueril, y como en esos años que ha consagrado al estudio del guardián ha llegado a conocer hasta las pulgas de su cuello de pieles, también suplica a las pulgas que lo ayuden a persuadir al guardián. Finalmente su vista se debilita y ya no sabe si en la realidad está oscureciendo a su alrededor o si lo engañan los ojos. Pero en aquellas penumbras descubre un resplandor inextinguible que emerge de las puertas de la Ley. Ya no le resta mucha vida. Antes de morir resume todas las experiencias de aquellos años en una pregunta, que nunca había formulado al guardián. Le hace una seña para que se aproxime, pues su cuerpo rígido ya no le permite incorporarse. El guardián se ve obligado a inclinarse mucho, porque las diferencias de estatura se han acentuado señaladamente con el tiempo, en desmedro del campesino. —¿Qué quieres saber ahora? –pregunta el guardián—. Eres insaciable. —Todos buscan la Ley –dice el hombre—. ¿Y cómo es que en todos los años que llevo aquí, nadie más que yo ha solicitado permiso para llegar a ella? El guardián comprende que el hombre está a punto de expirar y le grita, para que sus oídos debilitados perciban las palabras. —Nadie más podía entrar por aquí, porque esta entrada estaba destinada a ti solamente. Ahora cerraré.”

Your life is so very different, dearest. Except in relation to your fellow men, have you ever known uncertainty? Have you ever observed how, within yourself and independent of other people, diverse possibilities open up in several directions, thereby actually creating a ban on your every movement? Have you ever, without giving the slightest thought to anyone else, been in despair simply about yourself? Desperate enough to throw yourself on the ground and remain there beyond the Day of Judgment? How devout are you? You go to the synagogue; but I dare say you have not been recently. And what is it that sustains you, the idea of Judaism or of God? Are you aware, and this is the most important thing, of a continuous relationship between yourself and a reassuringly distant, if possibly infinite height or depth? He who feels this continuously has no need to roam about like a lost dog, mutely gazing around with imploring eyes; he never need yearn to slip into a grave as if it were a warm sleeping bag and life a cold winter night; and when climbing the stairs to his office he never need imagine that he is careering down the well of the staircase, flickering in the uncertain light, twisting from the speed of his fall, shaking his head with impatience. There are times, dearest, when I am convinced I am unfit for any human relationship.”

There’s a gale from the southwest today. The air in the square is swirling about. The tip of the Town Hall is teetering in small circles. All this agitation should be controlled. Every window pane is rattling and the lamp posts are bending like bamboos. The very robe of the Virgin Mary on her column is fluttering and the stormy wind is snatching at it. Is no one aware of this? The ladies and gentlemen who should be walking on the paving stones are driven along.

“Al in de vroege ochtend, het was bijna nog nacht, had Gregor de gelegenheid de kracht van zijn zojuist genomen besluiten te toetsen, want vanaf de gang opende zijn zuster, bijna volledig aangekleed, de deur en keek nieuwsgierig naar binnen. Zij kon hem niet dadelijk vinden, maar toen zij hem onder de canapé ontdekte - God, hij moest toch érgens zijn, hij had toch niet kunnen wegvliegen - , schrok zij zo, dat zij, zonder zich te kunnen beheersen, de deur van buitenaf weer dichtsloeg. Maar alsof zij berouw had van haar handelwijze, deed zij de deur meteen weer open en kwam, als ging het om een ernstige zieke of zelfs een vreemde, op haar tenen binnen. Gregor had zijn kop tot vlak aan de rand van de canapé naar voren geschoven en observeerde haar. Of zij wel zou merken dat hij de melk had laten staan, en wel allerminst uit gebrek aan eetlust, en of zij ander voedsel zou komen brengen, dat meer aan zijn wensen tegemoet kwam? Als zij het niet uit zichzelf deed wilde hij liever verhongeren dan haar erop attent te maken, hoewel hij eigenlijk een geweldige aandrang voelde om onder de canapé vandaan te schieten, zich aan zijn zusters voeten te werpen en haar om wat lekker eten te smeken. Maar zijn zuster zag dadelijk tot haar verbazing de nog volle kom, waaruit alleen rondom een beetje melk was gemorst, zij nam hem meteen op, weliswaar niet met haar blote handen maar met een lap, en droeg hem de kamer uit. Gregor was uiterst nieuwsgierig wat zij ter vervanging zou brengen en hij maakte zich daar de meest uiteenlopende voorstellingen van. Nooit had hij echter kunnen raden wat zijn zuster in haar goedheid werkelijk deed. Zij bracht hem, om zijn smaak te onderzoeken, een hele keur aan spijzen, op een oude krant uitgespreid. Er was oude, half verrotte groente; botten van het avondeten in een gestolde witte saus, wat rozijnen en amandelen; een kaas die Gregor twee dagen tevoren oneetbaar had verklaard; een stuk droog brood, een met boter besmeerd stuk brood en een met boter besmeerd en gezouten stuk brood. Bovendien zette zij bij dit alles ook nog de waarschijnlijk definitief voor Gregor bestemde kom neer, waarin zij water had gegoten.”

“There's another thing. You write about the people who have their evenings and mornings together and those who haven't. Just the position of the latter seems to me the more favourable. They have done something bad, certainly or possibly, and the dirt of this scene derives, as you rightly say, essentially from their being strangers, and it's physical dirt, like the dirt of an apartment which has never been inhabited and suddenly ripped wide open. This is bad indeed, or on Earth, it's actually nothing but a 'play with a ball' as you call it. It's as though Eve, having indeed plucked the apple from the tree (sometimes I believe I understand the Fall of Man as no one else), did so nevertheless only in order to show it to Adam - because she liked it. It was the biting into it that was decisive - the playing with it was, though not permitted, not forbidden either.”

Место это мне, что с личной, что с деловой стороны, одинаково противно. Всё меня раздражает, всё оглупляет меня, всё мне отвратительно.

En primer lugar, tú también rechazas cualquier culpa o responsabilidad de tu parte, en eso procedemos, pues, de la misma manera. Pero mientras que yo con toda sinceridad, tal y como lo pienso, te inculpo únicamente a ti, tú quieres ser al mismo tiempo “superlisto” y “superdelicado” absolviéndome también a mí de toda culpa. Esto último, obviamente, sólo lo consigues en apariencia (y eso es lo que quieres), y a pesar de toda tu “fraseología” sobre esencia y naturaleza y contraste y desvalimiento, lo que resulta entre líneas es que yo he sido en realidad el agresor, mientras que tú, todo lo que has hecho, lo hiciste en defensa propia. Con esa falta de sinceridad, ya habrías conseguido bastante, pues has demostrado tres cosas, primero que eres inocente, segundo que yo soy culpable, y tercero que tú, por pura magnanimidad, estás dispuesto no sólo a perdonarme sino incluso -lo que es más perotambién menos a probar y hasta a creer -en contra por supuesto de la verdad- que tambiényo soy inocente. Con eso ya te podría bastar, pero todavía no te basta. Se te ha metido en la cabeza que vives enteramente a mi costa. Admito que luchamos el uno contra el otro,pero hay dos clases de lucha. La lucha entre caballeros, en la que miden las fuerzasadversarios independientes: cada uno está solo, pierde solo, vence solo. Y la lucha delparásito, que no sólo pica sino que chupa instantáneamente la sangre que necesita paravivir. Eso es en el fondo el soldado profesional y eso eres tú también. Eres incapaz devivir; pero con el fin de instalarte en la vida cómodamente, libre de preocupaciones y sinreprocharte nada, demuestras que yo te he quitado toda la capacidad de vivir y que me lahe metido en el bolsillo. Qué te importa entonces no ser capaz de vivir, yo soy el culpable de ello, tú en cambio te tumbas tranquilamente y dejas que yo te arrastre, física y espiritualmente, por la vida. (...)».A ello respondo que la totalidad de esa objeción, que en parte puede volverse contra timismo, no viene de ti sino de mí, precisamente. Esa desconfianza que tú tienes hacia todono es, sin embargo, tan grande como la que yo tengo frente a mí mismo y en la que tú mehas educado.”

“...That, however, was not what our scholar was concerned to prove; for he maintained that the Great Wall alone would provide for the first time in the history of mankind a secure foundation for a new Tower of Babel. First the wall, therefore, and then the tower. His book was in everybody's hands at that time, but I admit that even today I cannot quite make out how he conceived this tower. How could the wall, which did not form even a circle, but only a sort of quarter- or half-circle, provide the foundation for a tower? That could obviously be meant only in a spiritual sense. But in that case why build the actual wall, which after all was something concrete, the result of the lifelong labor of multitudes of people? And why were there in the book plans, somewhat nebulous plans, it must be admitted, of the tower, and proposals worked out in detail for mobilizing the people's energies for the stupendous new work? There were many wild ideas in people's heads at that time -- this scholar's book is only one example -- perhaps simply because so many were trying to join forces as far as they could for the achievement of a single aim. Human nature, essentially changeable, unstable as the dust, can endure no restraint; if it binds itself it soon begins to tear madly at its bonds, until it rends everything asunder, the wall, the bonds, and its very self.”

“Cautious in all things, Uncle Jacob advised Karl for the time being to take up nothing seriously. He should certainly examine and consider everything, but without committing himself. The first days of a European in America might be likened to a re-birth, and though Karl was not to worry about it unduly, since one got used to things here more quickly than an infant coming into the world from the other side, yet he must keep in mind that first judgments were always unreliable and that one should not let them prejudice the future judgments which would eventually shape one's life in America. He himself had known new-comers, for example, who, instead of following these wise precepts had stood all day on their balconies gaping down at the street like lost sheep. That was bound to lead to bewilderment! The solitary indulgence of idly gazing at the busy life of New York was permissible in anyone travelling for pleasure, perhaps even advisable within limits; but for one who intended to remain in the States it was sheer ruination, a term by no means too emphatic, although it might be exaggerated.”

“Quite simple,” said the chairman, “you haven’t really come into contact with our authorities. All those contacts are merely apparent, but in your case, because of your ignorance of the situation here, you think they’re real. As for the telephone: look, in my own house, though I certainly deal often with the authorities, there’s no telephone. At inns and in places like that it may serve a useful purpose, along the lines, say, of an automated phonograph, but that’s all. Have you ever telephoned here, you have? Well then, perhaps you can understand me. At the Castle the telephone seems to work extremely well; I’ve been told the telephones up there are in constant use, which of course greatly speeds up the work. Here on our local telephones we hear that constant telephoning as a murmuring and singing, you must have heard it too. Well, this murmuring and singing is the only true and reliable thing that the local telephones convey to us, everything else is deceptive. There is no separate telephone connection to the Castle and no switchboard to forward our calls; when anyone here calls the Castle, all the telephones in the lowest-level departments ring, or all would ring if the ringing mechanism on nearly all of them were not, and I know this for certain, disconnected. Now and then, though, an overtired official needs some diversion—especially late in the evening or at night—and turns on the ringing mechanism, then we get an answer, though an answer that’s no more than a joke. That’s certainly quite understandable. For who can claim to have the right, simply because of some petty personal concerns, to ring during the most important work, conducted, as always, at a furious pace? Nor can I understand how even a stranger can believe that if he calls Sordini, for instance, it really is Sordini who answers. Quite the contrary, it’s probably a lowly filing clerk from an entirely different department. But it can happen, if only at the most auspicious moment, that someone telephones the lowly filing clerk and Sordini himself answers. Then of course it's best to run from the telephone before hearing a sound.”

“And so I learned things, gentlemen. Ah, one learns when one has to; one learns when one needs a way out; one learns at all costs. One stands over oneself with a whip; one flays oneself at the slightest opposition. My ape nature fled out of me, head over heels and away, so that my first teacher was almost himself turned into an ape by it and was taken away to a mental hospital. Fortunately he was soon let out again. 	But I used up many teachers, several teachers at once. As I became more confident of my abilities, as the public took and interest in my progress and my future began to look bright, I engaged teachers for myself, engaged them in five communicating rooms, and took lessons from all at once by dint of leaping from one room to the other.	That progress of mine! How the rays of knowledge penetrated from all sides into my awakening brain? I do not deny it: I found it exhilarating. But I must also confess: I did not overestimate it, not even then, much less now. With an effort which up till now has never been repeated I managed to reach the cultural level of an average European. In itself that might be nothing to speak of, but it is something insofar as it has helped me out of my cage and opened a special way out for me, the way of humanity. There is an excellent idiom: to fight one’s way through the thick of things; that is what I have done, I have fought through the thick of things. There was nothing else for me to do, provided that freedom was not to be my choice. 	As I look back on my development and survey what I have achieved so far, I do not complain, but I am not complacent either. With my hands in my trouser pockets, my bottle of wine on the table, I half lie and half sit in my rocking chair and gaze out of the window: If a visitor arrives I receive him with propriety. My manager sits in the anteroom; when I ring, he comes and listens to what I have to say. Nearly every evening I give a performance, and I have a success that could hardly be increased. When I come home late at night from banquets, from scientific receptions, from social gatherings, there sits waiting for me a half-trained chimpanzee and I take comfort from her as apes do. By day I cannot bear to see her; for she has the insane look of the bewildered half-broken animal in her eye, no one else sees it, but I do, and I cannot bear it. On the whole, at any rate, I have achieved what I have set out to achieve. But do not tell me that it was not worth the trouble. In any case, I am not appealing to any man’s verdict. I am only imparting knowledge, I am only making a report. To you also, honored Members of the Academy, I have only made a report.”

“You once said you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write (I can’t do much, anyway), but in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; that utmost of selfrevelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind—for everyone wants to live as long as he is alive —even that degree of selfrevelation and surrender is not enough for writing. Writing that springs from the surface of existence— when there is no other way and the deeper wells have dried up—is nothing, and collapses the moment a truer emotion makes that surface shake. This is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough. This is why there is never enough time at one’s disposal, for the roads are long and it is easy to go astray, there are even times when one becomes afraid and has the desire—even without any constraint or enticement—to run back (a desire always severely punished later on), how much more so if one were suddenly to receive a kiss from the most beloved lips! I have often thought that the best mode of life for me would be to sit in the innermost room of a spacious locked cellar with my writing things and a lamp. Food would be brought and always put down far away from my room, outside the cellar’s outermost door. The walk to my food, in my dressing gown, through the vaulted cellars, would be my only exercise. I would then return to my table, eat slowly and with deliberation, then start writing again at once. And how I would write! From what depths I would drag it up! Without effort! For extreme concentration knows no effort. The trouble is that I might not be able to keep it up for long, and at the first failure—which perhaps even in these circumstances could not be avoided—would be bound to end in a grandiose fit of madness.”

“Hace ya mucho que no le escribo, señora Milena, y también hoy le escribo por una casualidad. En realidad no tengo que disculparme de mi silencio, usted ya sabe cómo odio las cartas. Toda la desdicha de mi vida – no quiero con esto quejarme, sino hacer una observación de interés general- proviene por así decir de las cartas o de la posibilidad de escribirlas. Las personas casi nunca me han traicionado, pero las cartas siempre, y en verdad no las ajenas, sino justamente las mías. En mi caso es una desgracia muy especial, de la que no quiero seguir hablando, pero al mismo tiempo es una desgracia también general. La sencilla posibilidad de escribir cartas debe de haber provocado -desde un punto de vista meramente teórico- una terrible desintegración de almas en el mundo. Es en efecto una conversación con fantasmas ( y para peor no sólo con el fantasma del destinatario, sino también con el del remitente) que se desarrolla entre líneas en la carta que uno escribe, o aun en una serie de cartas, donde cada una corrobora la otra y puede referirse a ella como testigo. ¿De dónde habrá surgido la idea de que las personas podían comunicarse mediante cartas? Se puede pensar en una persona distante, se puede aferrar a una persona cercana, todo lo demás queda más allá de las fuerzas humanas. Escribir cartas, sin embargo, significa desnudarse ante los fantasmas, que lo esperan ávidamente. Los besos por escrito no llegan a su destino, se los beben por el camino los fantasmas. Con este abundante alimento se multiplican, en efecto, enormemente. La humanidad lo percibe y lucha por evitarlo; y para eliminar en lo posible lo fantasmal entre las personas y lograr una comunicación natural, que es la paz de las almas, ha inventado el ferrocarril, el automóvil, el aeroplano, pero ya no sirven, son evidentemente descubrimientos hechos en el momento del desastre, el bando opuesto es tanto más calmo y poderoso, después del correo inventó el telégrafo, el teléfono, la telegrafía sin hilos. Los fantasmas no se morirán de hambre, y nosotros en cambio pereceremos.”
